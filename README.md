Web scraping is an automated method used to extract large amounts of data from websites. The data on the websites are unstructured. Web scraping helps collect these unstructured data and store it in a structured form.

**To extract data using web scraping with python, you need to follow these basic steps:**

- Find the URL that you want to scrape
- Inspecting the Page
- Find the data you want to extract
- Write the code
- Run the code and extract the data
- Store the data in the required format

***Web Scrapping - Using python libraries***

#### Libraries used for Web Scraping

As we know, Python is has various applications and there are different libraries for different purposes. In our further demonstration, we will be using the following libraries:

- **Selenium:**  Selenium is a web testing library. It is used to automate browser activities.
- **BeautifulSoup:** Beautiful Soup is a Python package for parsing HTML and XML documents. It creates parse trees that is helpful to extract the data easily.
- **Pandas:** Pandas is a library used for data manipulation and analysis. It is used to extract the data and store it in the desired format. 

### **Tools for scrape the web**

**BeautifulSoup**

BeautifulSoup is another Python library, commonly used to parse data from XML and HTML documents. Organizing this parsed content into more accessible trees, BeautifulSoup makes navigating and searching through large swathes of data much easier. It’s the go-to tool for many data analysts.

**Scrapy**

Scrapy is a Python-based application framework that crawls and extracts structured data from the web. It’s commonly used for data mining, information processing, and for archiving historical content. As well as web scraping (which it was specifically designed for) it can be used as a general-purpose web crawler, or to extract data through APIs.

**Pandas**

Pandas is another multi-purpose Python library used for data manipulation and indexing. It can be used to scrape the web in conjunction with BeautifulSoup. The main benefit of using pandas is that analysts can carry out the entire data analytics process using one language (avoiding the need to switch to other languages, such as R).
